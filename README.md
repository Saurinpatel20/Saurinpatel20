### Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior (Grade 12) High School Student attending Sir Winston Churchill Secondary school in Canada. I am an ambitious programmer and working on enhancing my skills in advanced level programming for software development and engineering/robotics!

### ⚡ Uploading Projects
 * I usually upload my projects to Github once I have made significant programming progress or have completed the entire project
 * I also upload to showcase *semi-complete* projects that I will not be completing due to time restraints or other limitations
 
### 🎓 I am currently working on...
 * A Robotics Adaptive Pure Pursuit Motion algorithm using a differential drive with the Vex V5 platform
 * Creating a responsive website for my Github profile using HTML and CSS
 * Learning many programming languages fluently
